before making any changes always explain what you plan to do first.  
when I ask you to do something check the code to make sure it does not already do that or at least partially accomplish the goal.
make any proposed changes to the code and allow me to review before uploading
when I give you instructions you should append my statements to a file named .github/my-instructions.md
